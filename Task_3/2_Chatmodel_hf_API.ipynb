      "[ASST] The capital city of India is New Delhi. It is a planned city within the national capital territory of Delhi and serves as the center of the Government of India and the seat of all three branches of the government. However, New Delhi is not a constituent territory but a union territory, as the government-designated capital is New Delhi, and thus is not considered a state. Delhi itself forms a part of the National Capital Region (NCR) which also includes several districts in the adjoining states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. Prior to independence, Delhi was indeed the capital of India's colonial rulers, first the Mughals and later the British Raj. India's constitutional head, the President, resides in Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi. The Parliament of India and many government offices are located here, along with numerous other institutions, embassies, and historical sites. The city is also the seat of the Council of Ministers and many government ministries. The Capital Region has its own government, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, with an elected legislature and its own Chief Minister. The term \"National Capital Territory\" refers to the entire region, but Delhi is often mistakenly used to describe the entire National Capital Region, which includes several districts of the neighboring states, in addition to New Delhi. The New Delhi Railway Station (formerly New Delhi Junction) is the main inter-state railway station, while train services terminating within the city are served by Old Delhi Railway Station. The Delhi Metro serves the city and the NCR. The city is also a gateway to the country's international airport, Indira Gandhi International Airport, located in the suburbs of New Delhi. Other major cities nearby include Gurgaon, Faridabad, and Noida. The name \"Delhi\" traditionally referred to the walled city of Old Delhi, and the metropolis encompasses a larger area called the Delhi metropolitan area, which is further governed as the National Capital Region, the largest urban agglomeration in India by population, and the second-most populous in Canada, after Toronto. Between 1911-47, it was renamed multiple times and functioned as the imperial capital of several empires: the Mughals, the British Raj, the British Crown, and currently India. Delhi belongs to the Indian National Capital Region and together with its satellite cities forms the third-most populous metropolitan region in India after Mumbai-Chennai-Kolkata and Bangalore Metropolitan Region.\n",

      "Inactuality, Delhi and its suburbs form the National Capital Region, which in turn is part of the larger Delhi-NCR, being a shared capital with Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan; while a majority of the urban population reside in adjoining districts of these states, in these, therefore making Delhi a planned city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the popular tourist destinations include Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, Qutb Minar, Jama Masjid, India Gate, Rajpath, Jantar Mantar, Lotus Temple, and Akshardham. The Diwali and Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi and the Independence Day parade nearby are of national significance, while the city is an administrative, cultural, and educational hub and houses several prestigious universities, schools, hospitals, and research institutions. The dialect spoken here is Hindi, equivalent to Standard Hindi, a recognized national language, being mutually intelligible with neighboring Khari Boli. It is also known for its vibrant street food culture and urban lifestyle. Delhi is home to a dense network of arterial roads, but is also a transport checkpoint due to its location on major transportation routes, neighboring Pakistan and neighboring states. From colonial-era institutions, the city hosts many foreign embassies, while it is one of India's main economic and political centers as well as a major transportation hub, while the surrounding satellite cities host the country's largest IT zones. Delhi welcomes foreign dignitaries as a symbolic capital, and is poised to replace Mumbai and Bangalore as a startup hub.\n"
